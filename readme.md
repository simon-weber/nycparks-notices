# NYC Park Alerts has been shut down

This site used to provide a rec center closure/maintenance notification service until I shut it down in October 2022.
I didn't have a rec center nearby anymore, and with the combination of few users and <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter">Heroku discontinuing their free plan</a> I decided it wasn't worth the effort to maintain it.

The city's notices remain available at <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/news/notices">nycgovparks.org/news/notices</a>.

The old homepage for this site is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221010173103/https://parks.simon.codes/">on the Internet Archive</a>.
The site's code is open source and available [on Github](https://github.com/simon-weber/nycparks-notices).
